> But there is one extraordinary thing . . . when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower . . . 
>
> At one time I say to myself: "Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully . . ." Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars. 
>
> But at another time I say to myself: "At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night . . ." And then the little bells are changed to tears . . . 
>
> Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has--yes or no?--eaten a rose . . . 
>
> Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes . . . 
>
> And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!

In fact, I sometimes do the same, for what I care about, once something goes wrong, I will fall into endless anxiety, because I care about it enough, I am afraid that because of this negligence, my world will be completely different, but the reality is uncertain.
When I was young, once my mother was invited to an event and happened to stop by the kindergarten to see me, she left the gift she had brought to the event at the door, and within minutes of coming in to see me, the gift was stolen, and the news was told to me by the teacher who was in the kindergarten at the time. When I heard the news, I was so sad that I even started crying, and now I forget what I was crying for, but I don't want to be found crying at all, because I cried unreasonably.
Thinking about it now, I may have been plunged into endless anxiety because I cared enough, but as a child, crying was my only expression.

### ðŸ’¡Insights

------

In fact, there is a distance to genuine concern. The **protagonist** will not help the little prince raise roses or sheep because he cares, whether it is raising roses or sheep is the little prince's affairs, the little prince needs a mouth mask, and the protagonist gives him a mouth mask. The protagonist is always there to help the little prince when he needs it. In contrast, many parents now, when their children need to tie **shoelaces**, parents often directly help their children tie them for convenience, but tying shoelaces is a child's affairs, and what parents need to do should be to teach their children how to tie shoes. Similarly, parents will **interfere** with their children's learning because they are too concerned about their children's grades, but how the grades are the child's affairs, parents cannot interfere, and can only intervene when the child asks them for help. This may cause anxiety because of the child's poor grades, but isn't the protagonist the same? He is willing to bear that anxiety and never interfere in the affairs of the little prince, and that anxiety is the best proof that he cares about the little prince.

Finally, I would like to share with you a very interesting English phrase: **You can lead a horse to water.** The complete statement of this phrase should be: You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. Take the horse to the water's edge, and it is its affairs as to whether he drinks water or not. You can make it easy for someone to do something, but you cannot force them to do it.
